1) Project Architecture with production issues
2) What would you do differently in your project
3) LLD for a system similar to redis
Operations
- setValue(String value, String time)
- get(String key)
- delete(String key)

For the above you can have a hashMap called map

Also you need to think about expiring keys
For this you can have a separate HashMap called mapExpiry
And then run a scheduler say every 30 mins to clear all expiring keys
