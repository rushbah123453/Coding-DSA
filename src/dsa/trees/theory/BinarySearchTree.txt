Left node have less value then root
Right node have value greater then root

So we will add elements less then root node to left side
and greater then root to right side

Example: Root : 4  , elements: 1 2 3 5 6 7

Root:4
Left: 1 2 3
Right: 5 6 7

But suppose , it can happen that , all element are greater then root or all element are less then root

Root : 0
Elements: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So Here height of left tree is 0 , and we will get skrew tree

To avoid this drawback , We use Balance Tree/AVL Tree


When to use Balanced/AVL Tree?
- When | height of left - height of right |  > 1


Note:
All nodes in binary search tree is unique

Operations permformed in binary Search tree:

1)Find Max min and any x element
2)Insert
3)Delete
