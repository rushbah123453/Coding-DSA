1) To avoid race condition we use synchronization
2) Lock is used in order to avoid race condition

Types of synchronization
1) Synchronized method (Object level lock)
The entire method is synchronized ie. only one object can access at a time
Less performant than synchronized block.

2) Synchronized block (Object level lock)
Only a block of code is synchronized. Multiple threads can access the method, but the
block of code will be accessed only by one thread at a time.
More performant than synchronized method.
This method solves read modify write race condition

3) Static synchronized (Class level lock)
Static method is synchronized

Class level and object level locks are two different locks. Even if class level lock is acquired, some
other thread can access object level locks.
