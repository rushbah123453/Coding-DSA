TCP:

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol.
Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish
a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data.

TCP is reliable as it guarantees the delivery of data to the destination router.

An acknowledgment segment is present.

UDP:

UDP is the Datagram-oriented protocol.
This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection,
maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection.
UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast types of network transmission.

The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.

No acknowledgment segment.
