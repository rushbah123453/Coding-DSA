In operating systems that implement a virtual memory space the programs allocate memory from an address space
that may be much larger than the actual amount of RAM the system possesses. The OS is responsible for deciding
which programs "memory" is in actual RAM. It needs a place to keep things while they are "out". This is what
is called "swap space", as the OS is swapping things in and out as needed. When this swapping activity is
occurring such that it is the major consumer of the CPU time, then you are effectively thrashing.
You prevent it by running fewer programs, writing programs that use memory more efficiently,
adding RAM to the system, or maybe even by increasing the swap size.


Thrashing It is a state in which our CPU perform 'productive' work less and 'swapping' more.
CPU is busy in swapping pages, so much that it can not respond to user program as much as required.
Why it occurs In our system Thrashing occurs when there are too much pages in our memory,
and each page referes t an other page. The real memory shortens in capacity to have all the pages in it,
so it uses 'virtual memory'. When each page in execution demands that page that is not
currently in real memory (RAM) it place some pages on virtual memory and adjust the required page on RAM.
If CPU is so much busy in doing this task, thrashing occurs.
