Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non â€“ contiguous.

Logical Address or Virtual Address (represented in bits): An address generated by the CPU
Logical Address Space or Virtual Address Space( represented in words or bytes): The set of all logical addresses generated by a program
Physical Address (represented in bits): An address actually available on memory unit
Physical Address Space (represented in words or bytes): The set of all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses
