TreeSet

1)Firstly, insertion of null into a TreeSet throws NullPointerException because while insertion of null,
it gets compared to the existing elements and null cannot be compared to any value.

2)Secondly, if we are depending on default natural sorting order, compulsory the object should be
homogeneous and comparable otherwise we will get RuntimeException:ClassCastException

3)Every Object/data-type which we add in treeSet should implement comparable
otherwise  We will get RunTimeException :ClassCastException

4)The implementation in a TreeSet is not synchronized

HashSet vs LinkedHashSet vs TreeSet

HashSet: Doesnt maintains order , have unique elements(uses hashcode and equals())
LinkedHashSet: Maintains insertion order(uses hashcode() and equals())
TreeSet: Maintains asceding order(user compareTo())
