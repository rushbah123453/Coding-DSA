Sharding

1. sharding comes under the umbrella of partitioning
2. There are mainly 2 types of sharding
    a) Horizontal sharding
    b) vertical sharding
3. It is an optimization technique for storing databases


Lets assume you have 3 instances of db s1,s2,s3 and 3 masters for each m1,m2,m3
now when a request comes, an hashing algorithm will convert it to one of this (s1,s2,s3)
and then route to one of this instances.

This hashing algoritm can be a
    1) database or
    2) Routing service

Pros of sharding:

1. Scalability
2. Availability
3. Fault Tolerance

Cons of Sharding:

1. Complexity of sharding the data: introducing routing service and maintaining it
2. Non uniformity of data due to un-uniform data in shards
3. Resharding of data in shards
4. Querying could be difficult to bring/join different tables
