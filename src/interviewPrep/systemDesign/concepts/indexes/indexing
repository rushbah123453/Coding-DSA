Indexes:

1. It is used to improve read performance of database.
2. Mainly used for improving search performance and not for write
3. More number of indexes can decrease write performances

How indexes work?

Statement: Lets say a user base search books by author name
Solution: The author column is treated as key and indexed in index table and is sorted.
1. Index table will have 1 column with sorted author name and other column pointing to actual address of that row
2. Now this indexes are sorted and can be searched in logn time which decreases read complexity
3. But on other hand, when the table is updated, the indexes also needs to be updated, hence write performance decreases
