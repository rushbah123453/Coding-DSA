Cassandra:

1. Columnar DB: Stores data in hard-disk in columnar way
2. Cassandra is highly availableand follows AP of CAP Theorem
3. Cassandra have write capabilities on more then one node, so master is more then one for write
4. CQL is quering language
5. databases are knows as keyspace in cassandra and column family are tables
6. Cassandra contains various keys: prrimary,partition,composite,clustering keys
7. Composite key= partitionkey + clusteringkey


Mongodb:

1. It is DocumentDb: data is stored in document/json under collections
2. Mongodb is high;y consistent and follows CP from CAP
3. Mongodb is highly consistent and eventual-consistent(if configured to read from secondary node that is not master node)
4. It is highly consistent because the reads are performed on master node, it can become eventual consistent if the read is performed
from secondary nodes
5. JS Queries for quering // not so mature as compared to Cassandra


HBASE:

1. It is also columnardb and runs on top of hive
2. Follows CP from CAP
3. It uses map reduce to query the data
4. Used for Highly large analysis and to aggregate data
