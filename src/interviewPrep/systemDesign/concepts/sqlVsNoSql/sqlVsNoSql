SQL:

1. Structured data
2. SQL Query language used for queries
3. Use SQL When
    a) Data is structured and unchanging
    b) ACID Compliant
    c) Relation is required while extracting data
4. Horizontal scaling is achievable but complex
5. vertical scaling comes with a limitation of cpu,storage and is costly



NoSQL:

1. Unstuctured Data
2. Unstuctured Query Language is used (UQL)
3. Use noSQL when:
    a) Data is vastly increasing and is unstuctured
    b) not transactional data
4. Horizontal scaling is possible and is cheap
