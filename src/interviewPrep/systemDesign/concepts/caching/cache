1. Each app server can have cache on same instance to quickly get data
2. If App server is seating behind load balancer than each time instances will get random request
so everytime new calls could happen and cache would not be used in optimised way.
3. In this case CDN would be a perfect choice


Cahe Invalidation: Cache could contain stale data, we could get rid of this stale data using few techniques

1. Write through cache: update dp and cache together
2. Write around cache: first update db and delete from cache // Not sure though; update this
3. Writeback cache: update cache then update db

2. LIFO
3. LRU
4. LFU
5. Random
