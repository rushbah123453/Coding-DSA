Graphs are basically of 2 types

1)Undirected Graphs (no direction constraints, each vertices can access any adjacent vertex)
2)Directed Graphs (vertices can access only restricted vertices in direction)

Graphs can be represented in 2 ways

1)Adjacency Matrix (O(n^2))
2)Adjacency List (Best case: |n(vertices)|+|n(edges)|) , worst case (O(n^2)))
