Binary tree:

Binary tree: It can have atmost 2 children , i.e 0,1,2

There are 3 types of Binary Tree:

1) Strict/Perfect Binary tree:
          18
       /       \
     15         30
    /  \        /  \
  40    50    100   40
Every node should have 2 child or no children at all. All leaves are at same level

2) Full Binary Tree:
         18
       /    \
     15      20
    /  \
   40   50
  /  \
 30  50
Each node should have 0 or 2 children and leaf can be at any level


3) Complete Binary Tree:
            18
       /         \
     15           30
    /  \         /  \
  40    50     100   40
 /  \   /
8   7  9
All levels except last has to be completely filled
At the last level node should be as far as left possible


Operations:
Basic and Auxilary:

Basic Operations:
1)Inserting
2)Deleting
3)Search
4)Traversing tree

Auxilary Operation:
1)Find Size of tree
2(Find Height of tree
