Can be used for sorted arrays only
Initialize two pointer one at start, other at end
If value > expectedValue decrement end else increment start

Note: If it is stated that array is sorted, it is an indication that we can write and alorithm in a more optimal
way, possibly in O(n) or O(logn) time
When its given its sorted, you should use that information as an advantage to reduce complexity
