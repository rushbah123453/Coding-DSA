Mainly Threads have 5 states

1)New :When we instantiated Thread object Thread t=new Thread(new class);
2)Runnable : When we invocate start() i.e t.start();Here Thread is not running as it is not selected by scheduler
3)Running : Here thread is selected by scheduler and is in running state
4)Non-Runnable: sleep() wait() , thread is alive but not in running state
5)Terminated: thread exits the run()
