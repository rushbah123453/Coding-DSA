Context Switching:

Each process have N number of Threads.The act of stopping a threading and scheduling another thread
is called context Switching.

Generally, Number of Threads are far more then core ( Thumb Rule is to have 2x Threads
as that of core)

Context Switching :

1. Is not cheap,it consumes cpu and memory 
2. Context Switching in same process is cheaper then context switching between different process
