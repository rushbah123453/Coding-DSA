How to make class immutable ?

1)Remove Setters
2)Make the member variables as private
3)mark the class as final , so it cant be extended
4)making member variable final (optional)
5)Adding args constructor

String is immutable class in java

Immutable objects are thread safe because being immutable,
no matter which thread reads their values, they get the right values: they are immune to "memory consistency errors".

Why strings are immutable?
1) Security
2) SCP
3) Save memory

Example:
Lets assume that string where mutable, and key is string in hashmap,

String key="abc";
so map.put(key,"pune");
now internally hashmap will create hash-> #234 - > 15%10-> index=5 of bucket of linkedlist
so at a[5] -> a linkedlist with key="abc" and value="pune" is stored

now you change the string
key="xyz";

map.get(key) -> hashcode will be different -> and will return null
-> if somehow hashcode turns out to be same -> then will do equals -> will return pune
This is inconsistent behaviour right ?
